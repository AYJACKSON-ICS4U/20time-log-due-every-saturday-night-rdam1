# 20Time-ICS4U
A log for the 20 time project.

#### September 23, 2017
I've decided on making a Java and XML based mobile application (mostly for Android). I'm going to create a 2D sidescrolling game, and will be collaborating with Clement, Leon, and Ali.  

#### September 30, 2017
Completed Java course on codecademy.  

#### October 7, 2017
Switched 20 time project to learning another language. I have asked Mr. Barter for a Rosetta Stone account to do this. Until then, I am using Memrise and Duolingo to learn Japanese.  

#### October 14, 2017
Rosetta Stone doesn't offer Japanese; sticking with Memrise/Duolingo. 
Established goal of 15 minutes of learning a day on Duolingo.

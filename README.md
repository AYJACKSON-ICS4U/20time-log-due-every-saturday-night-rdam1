# 20Time-ICS4U
A log for the 20 time project.

#### September 23, 2017
I've decided on making a Java and XML based mobile application (mostly for Android). I'm going to create a 2D sidescrolling game, and will be collaborating with Clement, Leon, and Ali.  

#### September 30, 2017
Completed Java course on codecademy.  

#### October 7, 2017
Switched 20 time project to learning another language. I have asked Mr. Barter for a Rosetta Stone account to do this. Until then, I am using Memrise and Duolingo to learn Japanese.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/N3pTy7N.png" width=100 align=right>Rosetta Stone doesn't offer Japanese; sticking with Memrise/Duolingo.  
Established goal of 15 minutes of learning a day on Duolingo.  
Finished goal for today (see image on right).  
Still trying to figure out Memrise.  

#### October 21, 2017
Steadily progressing in learning Hiragana on Duolingo.  
Spent time familiarizing myself with Hiragana characters by writing them down in a notebook.  

#### October 28, 2017
Re-did Hiragana 1-2.  

#### November 4, 2017
Visited the Japanese Embassy with Mr. Barter's International Certificate Program.

We also did a worksheet on Japanese Katakana, a variation of Hiragana/another simplified version of Kanji.

#### November 11, 2017
Little to no progress was made on Duolingo this week or the week before.  
I think restarting the course and getting back into the habit of learning consistently will benefit me more rather than picking up where I left off when I barely remember anything.  
I guess this shows a sliver of how hard it is to commit to learning something on your own -- and on your own time too.  

#### November 18, 2017
I restarted Hiragana 1, and made it through 3 lessons on Friday.  
This involved re-doing the lessons, as well as re-writing all of the characters in my notebook.  
I learned the characters:  
い ("i"), ち ("chi"), に ("ni"),さ ("sa"),  
ん ("n"), よ ("yo"), ろ ("ro"), and く ("ku").  
Combinations of these characters give the numbers 1-6 (except 5, which I wasn't sure why).  

#### November 25, 2017
I completed Hiragana 2 (5 lessons), doing the same as last week.
The new characters learned were:  
む ("mu"), き ("ki"), る ("ru"), や ("ya"),  
け ("ke"), の ("no"), す ("su"), て ("te"),  
り ("ri"), ま ("ma"), た ("ta"), こ ("ko"),  
ら ("ra"), and わ ("wa").  

With this, I can now make the words:  
よる ("yoru"; night),  
きる ("kiru"; wear),  
よむ ("yomu"; read),  
やさい ("yasai"; vegetables),  
おさけ ("o sake"; sake),  
のむ ("nomu"; drink),  
すき ("suki"; like),  
すし ("sushi"; sushi),  
てりやき ("teriyaki"; teriyaki),  
あまい ("amai"; sweet),  
ほしい ("hoshi"; want),  
きたない ("kitanai"; dirty),  
こんにちは ("kon'nichiwa"; good afternoon),  
さようなら ("sayonara"; goodbye), and  
たし ("watashi"; I).  

### December 2, 2017
I went back and strengthened my Hiragana 1, as the app suggested,  
then continued to work on Hiragana 3, learning the characters:
ぬ ("nu"), ね ("ne"), と ("to"),  
せ ("se"), み ("mi"), and め ("me").  

I can now make the words:
いぬ ("inu"; dog),  
ねこ ("neko"; cat),  
とり ("tori"; bird),  
め ("me"; eye),  
せなか	("senaka"; back), and  
みみ ("mimi"; ear).

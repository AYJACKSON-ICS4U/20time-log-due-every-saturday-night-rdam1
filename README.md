# 20Time-ICS4U
A log for the 20 time project.

#### September 23, 2017
I've decided on making a Java and XML based mobile application (mostly for Android). I'm going to create a 2D sidescrolling game, and will be collaborating with Clement, Leon, and Ali.  

#### September 30, 2017
Completed Java course on codecademy.  

#### October 7, 2017
Switched 20 time project to learning another language. I have asked Mr. Barter for a Rosetta Stone account to do this. Until then, I am using Memrise and Duolingo to learn Japanese.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/N3pTy7N.png" width=100 align=right>Rosetta Stone doesn't offer Japanese; sticking with Memrise/Duolingo.  
Established goal of 15 minutes of learning a day on Duolingo.  
Finished goal for today (see image on right).  
Still trying to figure out Memrise.

Steadily progressing in learning Hiragana on Duolingo.  
Spent time familiarizing myself with Hiragana characters by writing them down in a notebook.  

### October 28, 2017
Re-did Hiragana 1-2.  

### November 4, 2017
Visited the Japanese Embassy with Mr. Barter's International Certificate Program.

We also did a worksheet on Japanese Katakana, a variation of Hiragana/another simplified version of Kanji.

Little to no progress was made on Duolingo this week or the week before.  
I think restarting the course and getting back into the habit of learning consistently will benefit me more rather than picking up where I left off when I barely remember anything.  
I guess this shows a sliver of how hard it is to commit to learning something on your own -- and on your own time too.
